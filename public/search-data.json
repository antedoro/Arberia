Mentre tu impari la modellazione 3D, io imparo a registrare e montare piccoli video tutorial. Come vedi si tratta comunque di uno scambio alla pari. Per registrare lo schermo sto usando OBS e per montare i video sto famigliarizzando con DaVinci Resolve.\nMolto probabilmente i miei tutorial sono lontani dall’essere perfetti e per questo gradirei che le tue critiche fossero anche aspre ma sincere. Ti chiedo pertanto di segnalarmi nei commenti qualsiasi errore o concetto poco chiaro e nella prossima tornata ce la metterò tutta per migliorare.\nIn questa serie di 5 video modelliamo un supporto per un albero composto da due parti:\nil supporto inferiore il guscio superiore Nel primo video modelliamo il supporto inferiore ed imparerai ad usare gli strumento Schizzo 2D e le funzioni Estrusione e Creazione guidata dei fori; Nel secondo modelliamo il supporto superiore che io chiamo guscio rafforzerai l’uso delgi strimenti del primo video. Nel terzo viseo comporremo l’assieme per verificare se ci sono interferenze tra i pezzi. Nel quarto e quinto video faremo la messa in tavola dei singili pezzi. Impareremo ad usare lo strumento Quota intelligente, compileremo il Cartiglio e produrremo la tavola stampabile in PDF.\nPer seguire il primo tutorial su Solidworks ti consiglio di scaricare la tavola in PDF che ho creato per te. Segui questo link e inizia l’esercizio:\nDownload\nCourse Slides (.pdf)\n1.3 MB\nSegui i prossimi post per realizzare gli altri tutorial.\n"

Perhaps, you’re hoping to attract technical recruiters to land your first programming job.\nMany coding bootcamp graduates are likely doing the same thing. To differentiate yourself from the crowd and boost your chances of getting noticed, you can start hosting your Django project online.\nFor a hobby Django project, you’ll want a hosting service that’s free of charge, quick to set up, user-friendly, and well-integrated with your existing technology stack. While GitHub Pages is perfect for hosting static websites and websites with JavaScript, you’ll need a web server to run your Flask or Django project.\nThere are a few major cloud platform providers operating in different models, but you’re going to explore Heroku in this tutorial. It ticks all the boxes—it’s free, quick to set up, user-friendly, and well-integrated with Django—and is the favorite cloud platform provider of many startups.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\nTake your Django project online in minutes Deploy your project to Heroku using Git Use a Django-Heroku integration library Hook your Django project up to a standalone relational database Manage the configuration along with sensitive data To follow along, you can download the code and other resources by clicking the link below:\nGet Source Code: Click here to get the companion Django project as well as snapshots of the individual steps followed in this tutorial.\nDemo: What You’ll Build You’re going to create a bare-bones Django project and deploy it to the cloud straight from the terminal.

Hang on and watch till the end for a quick preview of what you’re about to find in this tutorial:\nIn addition to the steps shown in the screencast above, you’ll find a few more later on, but this should be enough to give you a general idea about how you’ll be working with Heroku in this tutorial.\nProject Overview This tutorial isn’t so much about building any particular project, but rather hosting one in the cloud using Heroku. While Heroku supports various languages and web frameworks, you’ll stick to Python and Django. Don’t worry if you don’t have any Django projects on hand. The first step will walk you through scaffolding a new Django project to get you started quickly. Alternatively, you can use a ready-made sample project that you’ll find later.\nOnce you have your Django project ready, you’re going to sign up for a free Heroku account. Next, you’ll download a convenient command-line tool that will help you manage your apps online. As demonstrated in the screencast above, the command line is a quick way of working with Heroku. Finally, you’ll finish off with a deployed Django project hosted on your newly-configured Heroku instance. You can think of your final result as a placeholder for your future project ideas.\nPrerequisites Before jumping ahead, make sure that you’re familiar with the basics of the Django web framework and that you’re comfortable using it to set up a bare-bones project.\nNote: If you’re more experienced with Flask than Django, then you can check out a similar tutorial about Deploying a Python Flask Example Application Using Heroku.\nYou should also have a Git client installed and configured so that you can interact conveniently with the Heroku platform from the command line.

                "body": "This article offers a sample of basic Markdown syntax that can be used in Hugo content files.\nNote This article is a shameful copy of the great Grav original page.\nIf you want to know about the extended Markdown syntax of LoveIt theme, please read extended Markdown syntax page.\nLet\u0026rsquo;s face it: Writing content for the Web is tiresome. WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it\u0026rsquo;s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!\nTip :(far fa-bookmark fa-fw): Bookmark this page for easy future reference! 1 Headings Headings from h2 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;h2 Heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;h3 Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;h4 Heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;h5 Heading\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;h6 Heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Heading IDs To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading:\n### A Great Heading {#custom-id} The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;h3 id=\u0026#34;custom-id\u0026#34;\u0026gt;A Great Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; 2 Comments Comments should be HTML compatible.\n\u0026lt;!-- This is a comment --\u0026gt; Comment below should NOT be seen:\n3 Horizontal Rules The HTML \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; element is for creating a \u0026ldquo;thematic break\u0026rdquo; between paragraph-level elements. In Markdown, you can create a \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; with any of the following:\n___: three consecutive underscores ---: three consecutive dashes ***: three consecutive asterisks The rendered output looks like this:\n4 Body Copy Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; tags in the rendered HTML.\nSo this body copy:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; A line break can be done with one blank line.\n5 Inline HTML If you need a certain HTML tag (with a class) you can simply use HTML:\nParagraph in Markdown. \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;class\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This is \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;HTML\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Paragraph in Markdown. 6 Emphasis Bold For emphasizing a snippet of text with a heavier font-weight.\nThe following snippet of text is rendered as bold text.\n**rendered as bold text** __rendered as bold text__ The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;rendered as bold text\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Italics For emphasizing a snippet of text with italics.\nThe following snippet of text is rendered as italicized text.\n*rendered as italicized text* _rendered as italicized text_ The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;rendered as italicized text\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; Strikethrough In [GFM]^(GitHub flavored Markdown) you can do strikethroughs.\n~~Strike through this text.~~ The rendered output looks like this:\nStrike through this text.\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;del\u0026gt;Strike through this text.\u0026lt;/del\u0026gt; Combination Bold, italics, and strikethrough can be used in combination.\n***bold and italics*** ~~**strikethrough and bold**~~ ~~*strikethrough and italics*~~ ~~***bold, italics and strikethrough***~~ The rendered output looks like this:\nbold and italics\nstrikethrough and bold\nstrikethrough and italics\nbold, italics and strikethrough\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bold and italics\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; \u0026lt;del\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;strikethrough and bold\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/del\u0026gt; \u0026lt;del\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;strikethrough and italics\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/del\u0026gt; \u0026lt;del\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bold, italics and strikethrough\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/del\u0026gt; 7 Blockquotes For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document.\nAdd \u0026gt; before any text you want to quote:\n\u0026gt; **Fusion Drive** combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined.

Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel 7. Aenean sit amet erat nunc 8. Eget porttitor lorem The rendered output looks like this:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Integer molestie lorem at massa Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Aenean sit amet erat nunc Eget porttitor lorem The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Consectetur adipiscing elit\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Integer molestie lorem at massa\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Nulla volutpat aliquam velit\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Aenean sit amet erat nunc\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Eget porttitor lorem\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt; Tip If you just use 1. for each number, Markdown will automatically number each item. For example:\n1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet 1. Consectetur adipiscing elit 1. Integer molestie lorem at massa 1. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet 1. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit 1. Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel 1. Aenean sit amet erat nunc 1. Eget porttitor lorem The rendered output looks like this:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Integer molestie lorem at massa Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Aenean sit amet erat nunc Eget porttitor lorem Task Lists Task lists allow you to create a list of items with checkboxes. To create a task list, add dashes (-) and brackets with a space ([ ]) before task list items. To select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets ([x]).\n- [x] Write the press release - [ ] Update the website - [ ] Contact the media The rendered output looks like this:\nWrite the press release Update the website Contact the media 9 Code Inline Code Wrap inline snippets of code with `.\nIn this example, `\u0026lt;section\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt;` should be wrapped as **code**. The rendered output looks like this:\nIn this example, \u0026lt;section\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt; should be wrapped as code.\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;p\u0026gt; In this example, \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;\u0026amp;lt;section\u0026amp;gt;\u0026amp;lt;/section\u0026amp;gt;\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; should be wrapped with \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;code\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; Indented Code Or indent several lines of code by at least four spaces, as in:\n// Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code The rendered output looks like this:\n// Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;pre\u0026gt; \u0026lt;code\u0026gt; // Some comments line 1 of code line 2 of code line 3 of code \u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt; Block Fenced Code Use \u0026ldquo;fences\u0026rdquo; ``` to block in multiple lines of code with a language attribute.\n```markdown Sample text here... ``` The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;pre language-html\u0026gt; \u0026lt;code\u0026gt;Sample text here...\u0026lt;/code\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/pre\u0026gt; Syntax Highlighting [GFM]^(GitHub Flavored Markdown) also supports syntax highlighting.\nTo activate it, simply add the file extension of the language you want to use directly after the first code \u0026ldquo;fence\u0026rdquo;, ```js, and syntax highlighting will automatically be applied in the rendered HTML.\nFor example, to apply syntax highlighting to JavaScript code:\n```js grunt.initConfig({ assemble: { options: { assets: \u0026#39;docs/assets\u0026#39;, data: \u0026#39;src/data/*.{json,yml}\u0026#39;, helpers: \u0026#39;src/custom-helpers.js\u0026#39;, partials: [\u0026#39;src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}\u0026#39;] }, pages: { options: { layout: \u0026#39;default.hbs\u0026#39; }, files: { \u0026#39;./\u0026#39;: [\u0026#39;src/templates/pages/index.hbs\u0026#39;] } } } }; ``` The rendered output looks like this:\ngrunt.initConfig({ assemble: { options: { assets: \u0026#39;docs/assets\u0026#39;, data: \u0026#39;src/data/*.{json,yml}\u0026#39;, helpers: \u0026#39;src/custom-helpers.js\u0026#39;, partials: [\u0026#39;src/partials/**/*.{hbs,md}\u0026#39;] }, pages: { options: { layout: \u0026#39;default.hbs\u0026#39; }, files: { \u0026#39;./\u0026#39;: [\u0026#39;src/templates/pages/index.hbs\u0026#39;] } } } }; Note Syntax highlighting page in Hugo Docs introduces more about syntax highlighting, including highlight shortcode. 10 Tables Tables are created by adding pipes as dividers between each cell, and by adding a line of dashes (also separated by bars) beneath the header. Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.\n| Option | Description | | ------ | ----------- | | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates.

For example, each of these chapters:\n## Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. Note The specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works. 12 Footnotes Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.\nTo create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets ([^1]). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can’t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially.\nAdd the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text ([^1]: My footnote.). You don’t have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables.\nThis is a digital footnote[^1]. This is a footnote with \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;[^label] [^1]: This is a digital footnote [^label]: This is a footnote with \u0026#34;label\u0026#34; This is a digital footnote1.\nThis is a footnote with \u0026ldquo;label\u0026rdquo;2\n13 Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or:\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Stormtroopocat\u0026#34;) Like links, images also have a footnote style syntax:\n![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Dojocat\u0026#34; Tip LoveIt theme has special shortcode for image, which provides more features.

WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it\u0026rsquo;s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!\nTip :(far fa-bookmark fa-fw): Bookmark this page for easy future reference! 1 Headings Headings from h2 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;h2\u0026gt;h2 Heading\u0026lt;/h2\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h3\u0026gt;h3 Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h4\u0026gt;h4 Heading\u0026lt;/h4\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h5\u0026gt;h5 Heading\u0026lt;/h5\u0026gt; \u0026lt;h6\u0026gt;h6 Heading\u0026lt;/h6\u0026gt; Heading IDs To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading:\n### A Great Heading {#custom-id} The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;h3 id=\u0026#34;custom-id\u0026#34;\u0026gt;A Great Heading\u0026lt;/h3\u0026gt; 2 Comments Comments should be HTML compatible.\n\u0026lt;!-- This is a comment --\u0026gt; Comment below should NOT be seen:\n3 Horizontal Rules The HTML \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; element is for creating a \u0026ldquo;thematic break\u0026rdquo; between paragraph-level elements. In Markdown, you can create a \u0026lt;hr\u0026gt; with any of the following:\n___: three consecutive underscores ---: three consecutive dashes ***: three consecutive asterisks The rendered output looks like this:\n4 Body Copy Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with \u0026lt;p\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; tags in the rendered HTML.\nSo this body copy:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.

Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; A line break can be done with one blank line.\n5 Inline HTML If you need a certain HTML tag (with a class) you can simply use HTML:\nParagraph in Markdown. \u0026lt;div class=\u0026#34;class\u0026#34;\u0026gt; This is \u0026lt;b\u0026gt;HTML\u0026lt;/b\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/div\u0026gt; Paragraph in Markdown. 6 Emphasis Bold For emphasizing a snippet of text with a heavier font-weight.\nThe following snippet of text is rendered as bold text.\n**rendered as bold text** __rendered as bold text__ The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;rendered as bold text\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; Italics For emphasizing a snippet of text with italics.\nThe following snippet of text is rendered as italicized text.\n*rendered as italicized text* _rendered as italicized text_ The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;rendered as italicized text\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; Strikethrough In [GFM]^(GitHub flavored Markdown) you can do strikethroughs.\n~~Strike through this text.~~ The rendered output looks like this:\nStrike through this text.\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;del\u0026gt;Strike through this text.\u0026lt;/del\u0026gt; Combination Bold, italics, and strikethrough can be used in combination.\n***bold and italics*** ~~**strikethrough and bold**~~ ~~*strikethrough and italics*~~ ~~***bold, italics and strikethrough***~~ The rendered output looks like this:\nbold and italics\nstrikethrough and bold\nstrikethrough and italics\nbold, italics and strikethrough\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bold and italics\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt; \u0026lt;del\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;strikethrough and bold\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/del\u0026gt; \u0026lt;del\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;strikethrough and italics\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/del\u0026gt; \u0026lt;del\u0026gt;\u0026lt;em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;bold, italics and strikethrough\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/em\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/del\u0026gt; 7 Blockquotes For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document.\nAdd \u0026gt; before any text you want to quote:\n\u0026gt; **Fusion Drive** combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined. The rendered output looks like this:\nFusion Drive combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined.\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;blockquote\u0026gt; \u0026lt;p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;strong\u0026gt;Fusion Drive\u0026lt;/strong\u0026gt; combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined. \u0026lt;/p\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/blockquote\u0026gt; Blockquotes can also be nested:\n\u0026gt; Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue. Nunc augue augue, aliquam non hendrerit ac, commodo vel nisi. \u0026gt;\u0026gt; Sed adipiscing elit vitae augue consectetur a gravida nunc vehicula. Donec auctor odio non est accumsan facilisis.

Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel 7. Aenean sit amet erat nunc 8. Eget porttitor lorem The rendered output looks like this:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Integer molestie lorem at massa Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Aenean sit amet erat nunc Eget porttitor lorem The HTML looks like this:\n\u0026lt;ol\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Consectetur adipiscing elit\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Integer molestie lorem at massa\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Nulla volutpat aliquam velit\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Aenean sit amet erat nunc\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;li\u0026gt;Eget porttitor lorem\u0026lt;/li\u0026gt; \u0026lt;/ol\u0026gt; Tip If you just use 1. for each number, Markdown will automatically number each item. For example:\n1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet 1. Consectetur adipiscing elit 1. Integer molestie lorem at massa 1. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet 1. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit 1. Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel 1. Aenean sit amet erat nunc 1.

To create a task list, add dashes (-) and brackets with a space ([ ]) before task list items. To select a checkbox, add an x in between the brackets ([x]).\n- [x] Write the press release - [ ] Update the website - [ ] Contact the media The rendered output looks like this:\nWrite the press release Update the website Contact the media 9 Code Inline Code Wrap inline snippets of code with `.\nIn this example, `\u0026lt;section\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/section\u0026gt;` should be wrapped as **code**.

Note that the pipes do not need to be vertically aligned.\n| Option | Description | | ------ | ------------------------------------------------------------------------- | | data | path to data files to supply the data that will be passed into templates. | | engine | engine to be used for processing templates.

For example, each of these chapters:\n## Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-1\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-2\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u0026lt;a id=\u0026#34;chapter-3\u0026#34;\u0026gt;\u0026lt;/a\u0026gt; Content for chapter one. Note The specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works. 12 Footnotes Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.\nTo create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets ([^1]). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can’t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially.\nAdd the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text ([^1]: My footnote.). You don’t have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables.\nThis is a digital footnote[^1]. This is a footnote with \u0026#34;label\u0026#34;[^label] [^1]: This is a digital footnote [^label]: This is a footnote with \u0026#34;label\u0026#34; This is a digital footnote1.\nThis is a footnote with \u0026ldquo;label\u0026rdquo;2\n13 Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or:\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Stormtroopocat\u0026#34;) Like links, images also have a footnote style syntax:\n![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \u0026#34;The Dojocat\u0026#34; Tip LoveIt theme has special shortcode for image, which provides more features. This is a digital footnote\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\nThis is a footnote with \u0026ldquo;label\u0026rdquo;\u0026#160;\u0026#x21a9;\u0026#xfe0e;\n"

Everyone uses Markdown because it’s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.\nTo avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes.
