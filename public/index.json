[{"content":"Anche tu come me in questi giorni ti trovi bloccato a casa e sei in cerca di imparare qualcosa di nuovo? Allora vieni con me ad imparare la modellazione 3D con Solidworks. Mentre tu impari la modellazione 3D, io imparo a registrare e montare piccoli video tutorial. Come vedi si tratta comunque di uno scambio alla pari. Per registrare lo schermo sto usando OBS e per montare i video sto famigliarizzando con DaVinci Resolve.\nMolto probabilmente i miei tutorial sono lontani dall’essere perfetti e per questo gradirei che le tue critiche fossero anche aspre ma sincere. Ti chiedo pertanto di segnalarmi nei commenti qualsiasi errore o concetto poco chiaro e nella prossima tornata ce la metterò tutta per migliorare.\nIn questa serie di 5 video modelliamo un supporto per un albero composto da due parti:\nil supporto inferiore il guscio superiore Nel primo video modelliamo il supporto inferiore ed imparerai ad usare gli strumento Schizzo 2D e le funzioni Estrusione e Creazione guidata dei fori; Nel secondo modelliamo il supporto superiore che io chiamo guscio rafforzerai l’uso delgi strimenti del primo video. Nel terzo viseo comporremo l’assieme per verificare se ci sono interferenze tra i pezzi. Nel quarto e quinto video faremo la messa in tavola dei singili pezzi. Impareremo ad usare lo strumento Quota intelligente, compileremo il Cartiglio e produrremo la tavola stampabile in PDF.\nPer seguire il primo tutorial su Solidworks ti consiglio di scaricare la tavola in PDF che ho creato per te.

Perhaps, you’re hoping to attract technical recruiters to land your first programming job.\nMany coding bootcamp graduates are likely doing the same thing. To differentiate yourself from the crowd and boost your chances of getting noticed, you can start hosting your Django project online.\nFor a hobby Django project, you’ll want a hosting service that’s free of charge, quick to set up, user-friendly, and well-integrated with your existing technology stack. While GitHub Pages is perfect for hosting static websites and websites with JavaScript, you’ll need a web server to run your Flask or Django project.\nThere are a few major cloud platform providers operating in different models, but you’re going to explore Heroku in this tutorial. It ticks all the boxes—it’s free, quick to set up, user-friendly, and well-integrated with Django—and is the favorite cloud platform provider of many startups.\nIn this tutorial, you’ll learn how to:\nTake your Django project online in minutes Deploy your project to Heroku using Git Use a Django-Heroku integration library Hook your Django project up to a standalone relational database Manage the configuration along with sensitive data To follow along, you can download the code and other resources by clicking the link below:\nGet Source Code: Click here to get the companion Django project as well as snapshots of the individual steps followed in this tutorial.\nDemo: What You’ll Build You’re going to create a bare-bones Django project and deploy it to the cloud straight from the terminal.

While Heroku supports various languages and web frameworks, you’ll stick to Python and Django. Don’t worry if you don’t have any Django projects on hand. The first step will walk you through scaffolding a new Django project to get you started quickly. Alternatively, you can use a ready-made sample project that you’ll find later.\nOnce you have your Django project ready, you’re going to sign up for a free Heroku account. Next, you’ll download a convenient command-line tool that will help you manage your apps online. As demonstrated in the screencast above, the command line is a quick way of working with Heroku. Finally, you’ll finish off with a deployed Django project hosted on your newly-configured Heroku instance. You can think of your final result as a placeholder for your future project ideas.\nPrerequisites Before jumping ahead, make sure that you’re familiar with the basics of the Django web framework and that you’re comfortable using it to set up a bare-bones project.\nNote: If you’re more experienced with Flask than Django, then you can check out a similar tutorial about Deploying a Python Flask Example Application Using Heroku.\nYou should also have a Git client installed and configured so that you can interact conveniently with the Heroku platform from the command line.

WYSIWYG editors help alleviate this task, but they generally result in horrible code, or worse yet, ugly web pages.\nMarkdown is a better way to write HTML, without all the complexities and ugliness that usually accompanies it.\nSome of the key benefits are:\nMarkdown is simple to learn, with minimal extra characters, so it’s also quicker to write content. Less chance of errors when writing in Markdown. Produces valid XHTML output. Keeps the content and the visual display separate, so you cannot mess up the look of your site. Write in any text editor or Markdown application you like. Markdown is a joy to use! John Gruber, the author of Markdown, puts it like this:\nThe overriding design goal for Markdown’s formatting syntax is to make it as readable as possible. The idea is that a Markdown-formatted document should be publishable as-is, as plain text, without looking like it’s been marked up with tags or formatting instructions. While Markdown’s syntax has been influenced by several existing text-to-HTML filters, the single biggest source of inspiration for Markdown’s syntax is the format of plain text email.\nWithout further delay, let us go over the main elements of Markdown and what the resulting HTML looks like!\nTip :(far fa-bookmark fa-fw): Bookmark this page for easy future reference! 1 Headings Headings from h2 through h6 are constructed with a # for each level:\n## h2 Heading ### h3 Heading #### h4 Heading ##### h5 Heading ###### h6 Heading The HTML looks like this:\n\u003ch2\u003eh2 Heading\u003c/h2\u003e \u003ch3\u003eh3 Heading\u003c/h3\u003e \u003ch4\u003eh4 Heading\u003c/h4\u003e \u003ch5\u003eh5 Heading\u003c/h5\u003e \u003ch6\u003eh6 Heading\u003c/h6\u003e Heading IDs To add a custom heading ID, enclose the custom ID in curly braces on the same line as the heading:\n### A Great Heading {#custom-id} The HTML looks like this:\n\u003ch3 id=\"custom-id\"\u003eA Great Heading\u003c/h3\u003e 2 Comments Comments should be HTML compatible.\n\u003c!-- This is a comment --\u003e Comment below should NOT be seen:\n3 Horizontal Rules The HTML \u003chr\u003e element is for creating a “thematic break” between paragraph-level elements. In Markdown, you can create a \u003chr\u003e with any of the following:\n___: three consecutive underscores ---: three consecutive dashes ***: three consecutive asterisks The rendered output looks like this:\n4 Body Copy Body copy written as normal, plain text will be wrapped with \u003cp\u003e\u003c/p\u003e tags in the rendered HTML.\nSo this body copy:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad. The HTML looks like this:\n\u003cp\u003eLorem ipsum dolor sit amet, graecis denique ei vel, at duo primis mandamus. Et legere ocurreret pri, animal tacimates complectitur ad cum. Cu eum inermis inimicus efficiendi. Labore officiis his ex, soluta officiis concludaturque ei qui, vide sensibus vim ad.\u003c/p\u003e A line break can be done with one blank line.\n5 Inline HTML If you need a certain HTML tag (with a class) you can simply use HTML:\nParagraph in Markdown. \u003cdiv class=\"class\"\u003e This is \u003cb\u003eHTML\u003c/b\u003e \u003c/div\u003e Paragraph in Markdown. 6 Emphasis Bold For emphasizing a snippet of text with a heavier font-weight.\nThe following snippet of text is rendered as bold text.\n**rendered as bold text** __rendered as bold text__ The HTML looks like this:\n\u003cstrong\u003erendered as bold text\u003c/strong\u003e Italics For emphasizing a snippet of text with italics.\nThe following snippet of text is rendered as italicized text.\n*rendered as italicized text* _rendered as italicized text_ The HTML looks like this:\n\u003cem\u003erendered as italicized text\u003c/em\u003e Strikethrough In [GFM]^(GitHub flavored Markdown) you can do strikethroughs.\n~~Strike through this text.~~ The rendered output looks like this:\nStrike through this text.\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u003cdel\u003eStrike through this text.\u003c/del\u003e Combination Bold, italics, and strikethrough can be used in combination.\n***bold and italics*** ~~**strikethrough and bold**~~ ~~*strikethrough and italics*~~ ~~***bold, italics and strikethrough***~~ The rendered output looks like this:\nbold and italics\nstrikethrough and bold\nstrikethrough and italics\nbold, italics and strikethrough\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebold and italics\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e \u003cdel\u003e\u003cstrong\u003estrikethrough and bold\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/del\u003e \u003cdel\u003e\u003cem\u003estrikethrough and italics\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/del\u003e \u003cdel\u003e\u003cem\u003e\u003cstrong\u003ebold, italics and strikethrough\u003c/strong\u003e\u003c/em\u003e\u003c/del\u003e 7 Blockquotes For quoting blocks of content from another source within your document.\nAdd \u003e before any text you want to quote:\n\u003e **Fusion Drive** combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined. The rendered output looks like this:\nFusion Drive combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined.\nThe HTML looks like this:\n\u003cblockquote\u003e \u003cp\u003e \u003cstrong\u003eFusion Drive\u003c/strong\u003e combines a hard drive with a flash storage (solid-state drive) and presents it as a single logical volume with the space of both drives combined. \u003c/p\u003e \u003c/blockquote\u003e Blockquotes can also be nested:\n\u003e Donec massa lacus, ultricies a ullamcorper in, fermentum sed augue.

Aliquam id turpis in dolor tincidunt mollis ac eu diam.\n8 Lists Unordered A list of items in which the order of the items does not explicitly matter.\nYou may use any of the following symbols to denote bullets for each list item:\n* valid bullet - valid bullet + valid bullet For example:\n* Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet * Consectetur adipiscing elit * Integer molestie lorem at massa * Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet * Nulla volutpat aliquam velit * Phasellus iaculis neque * Purus sodales ultricies * Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem * Ac tristique libero volutpat at * Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel * Aenean sit amet erat nunc * Eget porttitor lorem The rendered output looks like this:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Integer molestie lorem at massa Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Phasellus iaculis neque Purus sodales ultricies Vestibulum laoreet porttitor sem Ac tristique libero volutpat at Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Aenean sit amet erat nunc Eget porttitor lorem The HTML looks like this:\n\u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003eLorem ipsum dolor sit amet\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eConsectetur adipiscing elit\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eInteger molestie lorem at massa\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eFacilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eNulla volutpat aliquam velit \u003cul\u003e \u003cli\u003ePhasellus iaculis neque\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003ePurus sodales ultricies\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eVestibulum laoreet porttitor sem\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eAc tristique libero volutpat at\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e \u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eFaucibus porta lacus fringilla vel\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eAenean sit amet erat nunc\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eEget porttitor lorem\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ul\u003e Ordered A list of items in which the order of items does explicitly matter.\n1.

Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel 7. Aenean sit amet erat nunc 8. Eget porttitor lorem The rendered output looks like this:\nLorem ipsum dolor sit amet Consectetur adipiscing elit Integer molestie lorem at massa Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet Nulla volutpat aliquam velit Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel Aenean sit amet erat nunc Eget porttitor lorem The HTML looks like this:\n\u003col\u003e \u003cli\u003eLorem ipsum dolor sit amet\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eConsectetur adipiscing elit\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eInteger molestie lorem at massa\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eFacilisis in pretium nisl aliquet\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eNulla volutpat aliquam velit\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eFaucibus porta lacus fringilla vel\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eAenean sit amet erat nunc\u003c/li\u003e \u003cli\u003eEget porttitor lorem\u003c/li\u003e \u003c/ol\u003e Tip If you just use 1. for each number, Markdown will automatically number each item. For example:\n1. Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet 1. Consectetur adipiscing elit 1. Integer molestie lorem at massa 1. Facilisis in pretium nisl aliquet 1. Nulla volutpat aliquam velit 1. Faucibus porta lacus fringilla vel 1. Aenean sit amet erat nunc 1.

For example, each of these chapters:\n## Table of Contents * [Chapter 1](#chapter-1) * [Chapter 2](#chapter-2) * [Chapter 3](#chapter-3) will jump to these sections:\n## Chapter 1 \u003ca id=\"chapter-1\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 2 \u003ca id=\"chapter-2\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Content for chapter one. ## Chapter 3 \u003ca id=\"chapter-3\"\u003e\u003c/a\u003e Content for chapter one. Note The specific placement of the anchor tag seems to be arbitrary. They are placed inline here since it seems to be unobtrusive, and it works. 12 Footnotes Footnotes allow you to add notes and references without cluttering the body of the document. When you create a footnote, a superscript number with a link appears where you added the footnote reference. Readers can click the link to jump to the content of the footnote at the bottom of the page.\nTo create a footnote reference, add a caret and an identifier inside brackets ([^1]). Identifiers can be numbers or words, but they can’t contain spaces or tabs. Identifiers only correlate the footnote reference with the footnote itself — in the output, footnotes are numbered sequentially.\nAdd the footnote using another caret and number inside brackets with a colon and text ([^1]: My footnote.). You don’t have to put footnotes at the end of the document. You can put them anywhere except inside other elements like lists, block quotes, and tables.\nThis is a digital footnote[^1]. This is a footnote with \"label\"[^label] [^1]: This is a digital footnote [^label]: This is a footnote with \"label\" This is a digital footnote1.\nThis is a footnote with “label”2\n13 Images Images have a similar syntax to links but include a preceding exclamation point.\n![Minion](https://octodex.github.com/images/minion.png) or:\n![Alt text](https://octodex.github.com/images/stormtroopocat.jpg \"The Stormtroopocat\") Like links, images also have a footnote style syntax:\n![Alt text][id] With a reference later in the document defining the URL location:\n[id]: https://octodex.github.com/images/dojocat.jpg \"The Dojocat\" Tip LoveIt theme has special shortcode for image, which provides more features.

However, there are a lot of things that Markdown doesn’t support well. You could use pure HTML to expand possibilities.\nBut this happens to be a bad idea. Everyone uses Markdown because it’s pure and simple to read even non-rendered. You should avoid HTML to keep it as simple as possible.\nTo avoid this limitations, Hugo created shortcodes. A shortcode is a simple snippet that can generate reasonable HTML code and conforms to Markdown’s design philosophy.\nHugo ships with a set of predefined shortcodes that represent very common usage.
