Once the post is ready, you can preview with hugo serve -D. This will generate a site to preview in a browser, you can visit the page at http://localhost1313.

NOTE the -D flag: This will tell Hugo to include draft posts when it builds the site. When generating new blog posts with Hugo, posts are set to draft: true by default. When you are ready to publish your post, change this to draft: false.
