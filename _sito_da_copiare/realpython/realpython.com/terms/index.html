<p>You represent and warrant that: (i) you have the legal right to use any credit card(s) or other payment method(s) in connection with any Purchase; and that (ii) the information you supply to us is true, correct and complete.</p>
<p>By submitting such information, you grant us the right to provide the information to third parties for purposes of facilitating the completion of Purchases.</p>

<h2 id="availability-errors-and-inaccuracies">Availability, Errors and Inaccuracies<a class="headerlink" href="#availability-errors-and-inaccuracies" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In order to provide exceptional service, and accuracy, we regularly update the products and services on the Service.</p>
<p>We cannot and do not guarantee the accuracy or completeness of any information, including prices, product images, specifications, availability, and services.

<h2 id="subscriptions">Subscriptions<a class="headerlink" href="#subscriptions" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>

<p>At the end of each Billing Cycle, your Subscription will automatically renew under the exact same conditions unless you cancel it or DevCademy Media Inc. cancels it. You may cancel your Subscription renewal either through your online account management page or by contacting DevCademy Media Inc. customer support team.</p>
<p>A valid payment method, including credit card or PayPal, is required to process the payment for your Subscription. You shall provide DevCademy Media Inc. with accurate and complete billing information including full name, address, state, zip code, telephone number, and a valid payment method information. By submitting such payment information, you automatically authorize DevCademy Media Inc. to charge all Subscription fees incurred through your account to any such payment instruments.</p>
