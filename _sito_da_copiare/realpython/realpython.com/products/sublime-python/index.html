<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-good-and-clear-instructions-on-how-to-make-sublime-more-python-friendly">Why is it so hard to find good and clear instructions on how to make Sublime more Python friendly?<a class="headerlink" href="#why-is-it-so-hard-to-find-good-and-clear-instructions-on-how-to-make-sublime-more-python-friendly" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>So many times I&rsquo;ve followed an online tutorial on how to set up Sublime Text and optimize my development workflow&mdash;only to get disappointed again.</p>
<p>Random blog posts rarely showed me how all the pieces fit together. And I found it difficult to get to a solid foundation for writing Python in Sublime Text:</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="most-sublime-text-setup-guides-i-looked-at-were-outdated-difficult-to-followor-just-plain-wrong">Most Sublime Text setup guides I looked at were outdated, difficult to follow&mdash;<u>or just plain wrong</u>&hellip;<a class="headerlink" href="#most-sublime-text-setup-guides-i-looked-at-were-outdated-difficult-to-followor-just-plain-wrong" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Still, with patience I&rsquo;d slowly managed to piece together an effective Python development setup over years of trial and error.</p>
<p>Until that fateful day, when I needed to switch operating systems to work on-site with a new client&hellip;and I had to re-build my whole Python development setup from scratch.</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="when-i-tried-setting-up-sublime-text-python-and-git-from-scratch-on-a-brand-new-windows-10-install">When I tried setting up Sublime Text, Python, and Git from scratch, on a brand new Windows 10 install…<a class="headerlink" href="#when-i-tried-setting-up-sublime-text-python-and-git-from-scratch-on-a-brand-new-windows-10-install" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Well, long story short: <strong><u>It was incredibly frustrating!</u></strong></p>
<p>(And it isn&rsquo;t even Windows&rsquo;s fault&hellip;just try the same on macOS or Linux.)</p>
<p>Strange &ldquo;wrong path&rdquo; errors, code linting was unreliable and slowed down my whole editor to a molasses-like crawl.</p>
<p>Auto-completion for Python code was useless, with confusing suggestions that often didn&rsquo;t match up with the code I had in front of me.</p>
<p>Configuring Git to let me use Sublime to write my commit messages took a full afternoon&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>I was shocked, to be honest!</strong></p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="because-im-a-python-programmerand-i-love-sublime-text">Because I&rsquo;m a Python programmer<br>and I love Sublime Text:<a class="headerlink" href="#because-im-a-python-programmerand-i-love-sublime-text" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>There&rsquo;s a certain nimbleness and agility about Sublime that I couldn&rsquo;t find in any other editing environment I tried.</p>
<p>I truly believe Sublime Text offers the best combination of performance, stability, and ergonomics you can get today.</p>
<p>With the right tuning it looks very attractive, too.</p>
<p>For me, it is the central tool in my development workflow.</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s also agonizing to set up:</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="it-takes-painstaking-work-to-get-to-a-good-setup-for-writing-python">It takes painstaking work to get to a good setup for writing Python&mdash;<a class="headerlink" href="#it-takes-painstaking-work-to-get-to-a-good-setup-for-writing-python" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>And I want every Python developer to be able to enjoy the best development environment possible.</p>
<p>Sure, the defaults are okay but you&rsquo;re really missing out on the <strong><u>biggest benefits</u></strong> Sublime has to offer, like:</p>
<div class="big-bullets-hand">
<ul>
<li><strong>Writing more Pythonic code with <u>real-time code linting feedback</u></strong></li>
<li><strong>Never having to hunt down docs again with <u>Python code-completion</u></strong></li>
<li><strong><u>Effortless auto-formatting</u> to prettify your Python code and make it PEP 8 compliant</strong></li>
<li><strong>Custom fonts and color schemes to <u>reduce eye strain</u></strong></li>
<li><strong>Smooth <u>team collaboration</u> with integrated source control (Git)</strong></li>
<li><strong>Advanced <u>command-line productivity techniques</u></strong></li>
</ul>

<p>There many guides out there on the internet on how to set up SublimeText, but they all have their shortcomings.</p>
<p>And not a single one of them starts 100% from scratch with a blank operating system install.</p>
<p>No wonder it&rsquo;s so difficult for Python developers to start their development environment with a solid foundation of tools that are working together:</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="randomly-slamming-in-plugins-and-tweaks-picked-up-from-blog-posts-rarely-works">Randomly slamming in plugins and tweaks picked up from blog posts rarely works&mdash;<a class="headerlink" href="#randomly-slamming-in-plugins-and-tweaks-picked-up-from-blog-posts-rarely-works" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In short, this situation sucks. And I finally understood the need for a detailed and easy to follow guide.</p>
<p>So, for the last couple of months, I&rsquo;ve been pouring my heart and soul into something that can make your life as a Python developer much better&mdash;</p>

<p>To put that in perspective, <strong>that&rsquo;s less than what you might pay for a decent keyboard</strong>.</p>
<p>As an <strong>investment in yourself and your productivity</strong> as a developer it will pay off many times over.</p>
<p>Because, as a software developer you have a rare gift: The skills you have are valuable and highly sought after.</p>
<p>And with the skills and productivity improvements you&rsquo;ll learn in this course (for less than the cost of a nice mouse), you can apply some leverage to those skills&hellip; and achieve amazing results.</p>

<p>&ldquo;A handy, well documented, tried &amp; tested &lsquo;Recipe-style Guide&rsquo; for setting up ST3 for Python development. And your instructions have worked out very well for me.</p>
<p><strong>What specific feature did you like the most about this guide?</strong> The level of detail; Software Developers are nothing if not Detail Oriented!</p>
<p><strong>What would be two other benefits about this guide?</strong> Introducing new users to ST3 and new Python developers. I fall squarely in both camps as someone who is currently learning Python for ML and Data Science, and I eventually gravitated towards ST3 instead of PyCharm.</p>
<p><strong>Would you recommend this guide?</strong> YES - absolutely! For the following reasons:</p>
<p>1) It&rsquo;s very important for a SW Developer to have a functional, working Dev Environment setup as it greatly impacts his/her Productivity.</p>
<p>2) This guide is very well-designed.&rdquo;</p>

<p>The last thing I want is for you to pass on this course because you’re not sure it’ll work for you. I know it <em>will</em> so here’s my offer to you:</p>
<p>Put me to the test. Take <em>Sublime Python: The Complete Guide to Sublime Text for Python Developers</em> for a spin today.</p>
<p>Spend just an hour with the video course today while I help you tune your Python development environment.</p>
<p>Then take up to a full year to use your newfound productivity.</p>
<p>And if for some reason you don&rsquo;t agree that I&rsquo;ve given you a more effective and productive way to write Python programs with Sublime Text, I will either:</p>
<p>1) Jump on Skype with you for 30 minutes of 1:1 coaching to help you get everything set up perfectly. My usual rate for 1-on-1 coaching is $250 an hour, so this is a risk for me. But I want you to succeed with this course.</p>
<p>2) Or, if you prefer, I&rsquo;ll cheerfully refund your money in full. No questions, no hassles, any time within the next year. You can even keep the bonuses just for giving the course a try.</p>
<p>Either way, all the risk is on me.</p>

<h1 class="crosshead">F.A.Q.</h1>
<h3 id="im-already-using-sublime-text-to-write-python-is-this-course-right-for-me">I&rsquo;m already using Sublime Text to write Python. Is this course right for me?<a class="headerlink" href="#im-already-using-sublime-text-to-write-python-is-this-course-right-for-me" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Great, you&rsquo;re going to get even more out of this course than somebody who&rsquo;s just getting started. Here, let me explain: You&rsquo;ve already been down this road. You *know* what all the pain points are. And you know what all of the holes are in your workflow…</p>
<p>So what you&rsquo;re going to get out of this course is filling in those gaps. Because of your prior experience you&rsquo;ll be able to go through the course quickly and you&rsquo;ll be using it to &ldquo;spot check&rdquo; your workflow and fill in the holes.</p>
<p>Rather than having to start from scratch and learning all this brand new stuff (and potentially being overwhelmed by all of it) you&rsquo;ll just be filling in those blank spots in your workflow. And that&rsquo;s going to be faster and easier. Basically, you&rsquo;ll end up further ahead than somebody who&rsquo;s starting from scratch.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-need-to-start-from-a-clean-os-install-to-take-this-course">Do I need to start from a clean OS install to take this course?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-i-need-to-start-from-a-clean-os-install-to-take-this-course" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Short answer: No.</p>
<p>You can mix and match and continue to build on your existing setup.</p>
<p>The course is structured such that it shows you how to install everything from a completely blank slate and &ldquo;clean OS install&rdquo;, but you can also skip these parts and to simply start with improving your existing Sublime Text setup.</p>
<p>In some cases I would recommend backing up the existing ST settings and then restarting those from a clean slate, but by no means are you required to wipe your OS install for this course to help you.</p>
<h3 id="is-the-course-specifically-made-for-python-developers">Is the course specifically made for Python developers?<a class="headerlink" href="#is-the-course-specifically-made-for-python-developers" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>Yes. The whole course is specifically aimed at setting up a great development environment for Python. I&rsquo;d estimate that about 30-50% of the tips apply to other languages as well (for example, how to make your Sublime Text look more attractive) but it really is a guide that specifically addresses the needs of Python developers.</p>
<h3 id="wow-i-looked-at-the-package-and-theres-several-hours-of-video-in-here-that-seems-like-a-lot-of-work-how-am-i-gonna-get-this-setup-in-an-afternoon">Wow, I looked at the package and there&rsquo;s several hours of video in here. That seems like a lot of work. How am I gonna get this setup in an afternoon?<a class="headerlink" href="#wow-i-looked-at-the-package-and-theres-several-hours-of-video-in-here-that-seems-like-a-lot-of-work-how-am-i-gonna-get-this-setup-in-an-afternoon" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>If you add up the video lessons across all three platforms, there&rsquo;s around 280 minutes of video.</p>
<p>However, there&rsquo;s two ways you can go through this course:</p>
<p>You can &ldquo;fast track&rdquo; it in an hour or less by skimming through the the PDF guide, installing all the tools and plugins, and then copy &amp; pasting the settings. This gets you to an effective Sublime Text setup for Python development very quickly.</p>
<p>Or, you can step your way through the course by watching all the videos for your platform in sequence (around 90 minutes). It&rsquo;ll take a little longer, but you&rsquo;re going to get so much out of it—You&rsquo;ll be setting up your environment from scratch and you&rsquo;ll see exactly how and why I add each setting and plugin to the mix. So you know exactly what&rsquo;s going on and you know what you can tweak and modify to personalize your setup.</p>
<h3 id="how-do-i-know-this-course-works-for-me-is-there-a-guarantee">How do I know this course works for me? Is there a guarantee?<a class="headerlink" href="#how-do-i-know-this-course-works-for-me-is-there-a-guarantee" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>I&rsquo;ve “road tested” and improved this course for more than 5 months. At this point hundreds of developers have gone through it from start to finish.</p>
<p>Here’s what a few of them had to say:</p>
<blockquote>
<p>“So many times I’ve followed an online tutorial but they haven’t shown how it all fits together. Great examples of useful addons &amp; settings. A great tutorial guide. Especially for a newcomer to MacOS like me. Great quality.”</p>
<p>— Anthony F.</p>
<p>“Thought it might be like all the other how-to guides that don’t quite guide a beginner all the way through. But Sublime Python makes setting up sublime for a newbie extremely easy. The guide helps you get a fully working development environment almost like an IDE easily, especially if you are a newbie and the added bonus of finding some settings that quite frankly I had not bothered with before.”</p>
<p>— Isaac Dadzie</p>
</blockquote>
<p>The course comes with a full ONE YEAR guarantee, so if you’re still on the fence you can try it with no risk.</p>
<h3 id="do-i-get-lifetime-access-or-is-there-a-monthly-fee-to-access-the-course">Do I get lifetime access or is there a monthly fee to access the course?<a class="headerlink" href="#do-i-get-lifetime-access-or-is-there-a-monthly-fee-to-access-the-course" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>It&rsquo;s a one-time payment for the whole course. As soon as you buy the course you&rsquo;ll get instant access where watch and read all of the content and consume it however you like, for how long you want.</p>
<h3 id="im-interested-in-this-course-but-the-price-seems-high">I&rsquo;m interested in this course, but the price seems high.<a class="headerlink" href="#im-interested-in-this-course-but-the-price-seems-high" title="Permanent link"></a></h3>
<p>(Not really a question, but that’s okay.)</p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p>I love a frugal mindset and when it comes to parting with my hard-earned cash, I’m about as cheap as they come.</p>
<p>When I’m agonizing over a decision like this, I’ll often ask myself this question:</p>
<p>Is what I’m about to buy here an expense, something that simply takes money out of my pocket…</p>
<p>Or is it an *investment*—a purchase that costs me money in the short term but earns me exponential returns in the months and years ahead?</p>
<p>So is Sublime Python an expense, or an investment?</p>
<p>Honestly, that’s up to you.</p>
<p>If you end up buying the course and watch it for the entertainment value… Or if you get it today and then set it aside “for later”, then it’s probably an expense. And in that case I’d rather you DIDN’T buy it. Hang onto your money and put it toward something you’ll really benefit from.</p>
<p>However&hellip;</p>
<p>If you’re willing to take this course and incorporate the settings and plugins into your development setup… Then I guarantee you’re going to be happy with the return for your investment.</p>
<p>Look at it this way:</p>
<p>Investing in your editor setup will improve the quality of the code you write and prevent you from making &ldquo;silly&rdquo;, slip-of-the-mind type of errors. It will therefore increase your speed and productivity as a programmer.</p>
<p>What’s a good developer make per hour? In the U.S., wages often range from $25 to $50 per hour. Where you live it might be more or less.</p>
<p>But just for discussion, let’s say you make $15 an hour.</p>
<p>If this course saves you an hour per week in otherwise lost productivity, that’s $780 worth of your time each year. You can use that time to relax, or reinvest it and get ahead in your development career, or spend it however else you’d like.</p>
<p>The choice is yours. I know what I’d do.</p>
