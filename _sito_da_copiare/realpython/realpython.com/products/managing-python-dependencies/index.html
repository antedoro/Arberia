<p>Dear Fellow Python Developer,</p>
<p>Not too long ago PyPI, the Python packaging repository, crossed <em>100,000</em> available third-party packages in total.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s an <em>overwhelming</em> number of packages to choose from&mdash;</p>
<p>And this feeling of overwhelm and &ldquo;choice paralysis&rdquo; is exactly what held me back earlier on in my Python career.</p>
<p>Here, let me explain:</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="back-when-i-got-serious-about-building-my-python-skills-mastering-the-syntax-of-the-language-was-not-the-hardest-part">Back when I got &ldquo;serious&rdquo; about building my Python skills, mastering the syntax of the language was <u>not</u> the hardest part<a class="headerlink" href="#back-when-i-got-serious-about-building-my-python-skills-mastering-the-syntax-of-the-language-was-not-the-hardest-part" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Python&rsquo;s syntax seemed quite clear and intuitive by comparison, and I saw a (relatively) obvious path to learning it.</p>
<p>But when it came to Python&rsquo;s 100k+ libraries and frameworks&mdash;</p>
<p>That was simply an OVERWHELMING amount of information to digest.</p>
<p>Even when I <em>knew there had to be</em> a library out there that already solved a problem I was facing&mdash;I drew a blank when it came to researching it.</p>
<p>I didn&rsquo;t know what made a Python library or framework worthwhile.</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="everything-blended-together-into-a-sea-of-modules-and-i-couldnt-winnow-out-the-useless-or-obsolete">Everything blended together into a &ldquo;sea of modules&rdquo; and I <u>couldn&rsquo;t winnow out</u> the useless or obsolete&mdash;<a class="headerlink" href="#everything-blended-together-into-a-sea-of-modules-and-i-couldnt-winnow-out-the-useless-or-obsolete" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>In short, I was <em>lost</em> when it came to finding and judging the quality of Python libraries.</p>
<p>And so I spun my wheels&hellip;</p>
<div class="flex-grid">
<div class="col">
<p style="margin-top: 0;">Hi, my name is Dan Bader.</p>
<p>Today I&rsquo;m an independent software engineer, book author, and speaker. I&rsquo;ve been writing code for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>Python is my favorite programming language and these days I&rsquo;m fortunate to get to use Python almost every day in my work.</p>
<p>What tripped me up as a fledgling Pythonista was this&mdash;</p>
<p>I had the basics of Python under my belt, but:</p>

<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="i-struggled-when-it-came-to-adopting-the-right-workflows-and-tools-of-the-ecosystem-surrounding-the-core-language">I struggled when it came to adopting the right workflows and tools of the &ldquo;ecosystem&rdquo; surrounding the core language<a class="headerlink" href="#i-struggled-when-it-came-to-adopting-the-right-workflows-and-tools-of-the-ecosystem-surrounding-the-core-language" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Thus, I <u>wasted my time</u> reinventing existing solutions left and right&mdash;</p>
<p>Sometimes I spent DAYS writing my own (crappy) versions of common building blocks like config file parsers, data validators, or visualization tools.</p>
<p>Now, sure I learned quite a bit from doing that&hellip;</p>
<p>But I <u>kept repeating</u> the same mistake and was &ldquo;reinventing the wheel&rdquo; even when under a tight deadline.</p>
<p>In hindsight, my ignorance caused me a ton of undue stress and sleep deprivation.</p>
<p>Part of it was overconfidence in my abilities&mdash;and another part was that</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="i-lacked-experience-using-bread-and-butter-tools-like-the-pip-package-manager-virtual-environments-and-requirements-files">I lacked experience using &ldquo;bread and butter&rdquo; tools like the pip package manager, virtual environments, and requirements files.<a class="headerlink" href="#i-lacked-experience-using-bread-and-butter-tools-like-the-pip-package-manager-virtual-environments-and-requirements-files" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>And it prevented me from breaking through to the next phase of developing code in Python.</p>
<p>You see, languages such as C++ that I used before didn&rsquo;t have an advanced package management system like Python.</p>
<p>Because I was used to &ldquo;copy-pasting&rdquo; third-party code into my own projects I missed out on the versioning features in Python packages.</p>
<p>And instead of building applications that combined the power of several specialized building blocks</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="i-strung-together-messy-copypasta-globs-of-code-that-i-couldnt-get-to-run-on-anyone-elses-computer">I strung together messy &ldquo;copypasta&rdquo; globs of code that I couldn&rsquo;t get to run on anyone else&rsquo;s computer<a class="headerlink" href="#i-strung-together-messy-copypasta-globs-of-code-that-i-couldnt-get-to-run-on-anyone-elses-computer" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Today I know I&rsquo;m not the only developer who had to overcome &ldquo;reinventing the wheel disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Tragically, it is a <u>hidden roadblock</u> to many aspiring Pythonistas:</p>
<p>What separates experienced Python programmers from learners is that they create new functionality with building blocks they already know.</p>
<p>And leveraging these building blocks requires a vast set of inter-related pieces of knowledge&mdash;from packages to deployment:</p>
<p><img alt="" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/questions-annotated.1828eaa9544f.png" /></p>
<p>Now, most &ldquo;stuck&rdquo; Python developers are <u>aware</u> of the tools that could help them ascend from &ldquo;dependency hell&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>But they don&rsquo;t see how to use them to their advantage.</p>
<p>If you ask a group of junior or intermediate Python developers about their experience you&rsquo;ll hear things like:</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="ive-heard-people-say-you-should-always-use-a-virtualenv-but-i-dont-really-see-why-seems-like-an-additional-step-i-dont-really-need">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve heard people say &lsquo;you should always use a virtualenv&rsquo; but I don&rsquo;t really see why. <strong>Seems like an additional step I don&rsquo;t really need&hellip;</strong>&ldquo;<a class="headerlink" href="#ive-heard-people-say-you-should-always-use-a-virtualenv-but-i-dont-really-see-why-seems-like-an-additional-step-i-dont-really-need" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>You see, the problem is this:</p>
<p>Too many Python developers know these tools <u>exist</u>, but they don&rsquo;t see <u>why</u> they&rsquo;re important and what makes them so powerful.</p>
<p>And tragically, by ignoring the help that tools like pip, virtualenv, and PyPI provide these developers <u>sabotage</u> their own productivity.</p>
<p>Ask yourself this:</p>
<p>If you use Python and you&rsquo;re wondering how to go from &ldquo;writing scripts&rdquo; to &ldquo;building applications&rdquo;&mdash;</p>
<p>Then there&rsquo;s a good chance that</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="missing-dependency-management-skills-are-holding-you-back-from-your-full-potential-as-a-python-developer">Missing Dependency Management skills are holding you back from <u>your full potential</u> as a Python developer<a class="headerlink" href="#missing-dependency-management-skills-are-holding-you-back-from-your-full-potential-as-a-python-developer" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>If you can fill in those gaps in your knowledge your productivity and efficiency as a Python developer will benefit greatly.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s what happened to me&mdash;</p>
<p>Once I got the hang of Python&rsquo;s dependency management tools and workflows I was quickly able to shake off my &ldquo;reinventing the wheel disease.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I can see now how removing this roadblock triggered a &ldquo;quantum leap&rdquo; in my productivity as a software developer.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the secret:</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="by-leveraging-pythons-packaging-ecosystem-you-will-be-coding-at-a-higher-level-of-abstraction">By leveraging Python&rsquo;s packaging ecosystem you will be <strong>coding at a higher level</strong> of abstraction&mdash;<a class="headerlink" href="#by-leveraging-pythons-packaging-ecosystem-you-will-be-coding-at-a-higher-level-of-abstraction" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>Instead of wasting time re-coding tools and functionality that already existed, I was able focus on the business goals.</p>
<p>Figuring this out had a MASSIVE impact on my productivity and efficiency as a Python developer.</p>
<p>Saying it allowed me to &ldquo;10X&rdquo; my output wouldn&rsquo;t be too far off.</p>
<p>Within a month my peers and superiors had noticed my improved productivity&mdash;because they saw me tearing through sprint tickets left and right.</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="its-one-of-the-easiest-and-quickest-wins-you-can-get-in-your-python-career">It&rsquo;s one of the easiest and quickest &ldquo;wins&rdquo; you can get in your Python career<a class="headerlink" href="#its-one-of-the-easiest-and-quickest-wins-you-can-get-in-your-python-career" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>I&rsquo;ve seen it happen several times with 1:1 coaching clients and during workshops.</p>
<p>But this kind of training can only reach so many people.</p>
<p>And I wanted every Python developer to be able to take advantage of modern dependency management workflows and tools.</p>
<p>So I got to work&hellip;</p>
<p>And now, after months of recording and editing I&rsquo;m proud to introduce:</p>

<div class="big-bullets">
<ul>
<li>Install, use, and manage third-party Python packages with the &ldquo;pip&rdquo; package manager on Windows, macOS, and Linux.</li>
<li>Isolate project dependencies with so-called virtual environments to avoid version conflicts in your Python projects.</li>
<li>Apply a complete 7-step workflow for finding and identifying quality third-party packages to use in your own Python projects (and justifying your decisions to your team or manager.)</li>
<li>Set up repeatable development environments and application deployments using the &ldquo;pip&rdquo; package manager and requirements files.</li>

<div class="big-bullets-hand">
<ul>
<li><strong>This course is for Python developers</strong> wanting to break through to the next phase of developing code by becoming more <u>efficient, productive, and skilled</u> using Python&rsquo;s rich library ecosystem.</li>
<li>If you&rsquo;ve ever caught yourself thinking <em>&ldquo;There&rsquo;s got to be a Python package out there that does exactly what I want&hellip;But how do I find it?&rdquo;</em> this course will fill in the missing pieces for you. Discover the industry best practices around choosing and managing third-party dependencies for your Python 2 or Python 3 projects.</li>
<li>If you already know how to use alternative package managers like <em>Conda</em> you&rsquo;ll discover how to use the standards-compliant tools and workflows supported by any Python distribution and used in most production application deployments.</li>

<div class="big-bullets-hand">
<ul>
<li><strong>This course is probably not for you</strong> if you already have an in-depth understanding of how packaging works in Python, you&rsquo;re 100% happy with your current workflow for managing dependencies, you know how to find and identify quality Python packages for any situation, and you you can easily justify your decisions to your team or manager.</li>

<p>When I totaled it up, the complete course package contains a whopping $657 worth of Python training.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s a &ldquo;one-stop shop&rdquo; for the dependency management skills and best practices that professional Python engineers are expected to know.</p>
<p>With this course you&rsquo;re making the smartest kind of investment there is&mdash;an investment in yourself and your own abilities as a developer.</p>
<p>And an investment like this could easily pay you back 50X or 100X in the next year.</p>
<p>That might sound over the top, but it&rsquo;s actually pretty realistic.</p>
<p>Think about it&hellip;</p>
<p>The workflows and best practices you&rsquo;ll get from this course are &ldquo;table stakes&rdquo; for senior-level Python development jobs.</p>
<p>Dependency management and application deployment is one of those &ldquo;icky&rdquo; but important topics that&rsquo;s often overlooked by inexperienced developers.</p>
<p>With your newfound skill set you&rsquo;ll be able to demonstrate that you care about *shipping* a quality product and not &ldquo;just coding&rdquo; it.</p>
<p>You&rsquo;ll be able to help your colleagues with your expertise. Teaching your coworkers new tricks and workflows that make them more productive is the best way to get recognized as an expert.</p>
<p>Pulling everyone else around you UP and making them more productive is a fantastic way to show you&rsquo;re ready to take on more responsibility&mdash;which in turn is one of the best ways to get yourself promoted.</p>
<p>Here&rsquo;s the kicker:</p>
<p>Even though the &ldquo;return on investment&rdquo; for this course is excellent, I wanted it to price it so it is affordable for <em>all</em> Pythonistas in my audience.</p>
<p>That&rsquo;s why I&rsquo;m pricing the course at a fair</p>
<h1 class="crosshead thin highlight" id="49">$49<a class="headerlink" href="#49" title="Permanent link"></a></h1>
<p>This offer is for the complete course, including all bonuses.</p>
<p>To put that in perspective, that&rsquo;s less than what you might pay for a decent keyboard or mouse.</p>
<p>And as an investment in yourself and your development career it will pay off many times over, quickly.</p>
<p>Now before we go on, let&rsquo;s take a look at what you get in the course package:</p>

<p>&ldquo;I took this course in hopes that I may learn a few things. I already use virtual environments and was familiar with that concept.</p>
<p><strong>I found your course to be very informative, thoughtfully approached, and easy to understand.</strong></p>
<p><strong>You did not leave me behind and, in no part, did I feel lost or confused. In fact, count me in on your next course!</strong></p>
<p>I thought that the presentation as a workflow was very helpful. Nice and sequential.</p>
<p>You answered several questions that I have had, especially with managing the requirements.txt file.</p>
<p>The audio and video quality are really good. The colors chosen contrast nicely which makes reading the bullet points, etc easy while you are talking.</p>
<p>The font size of the presented material in the videos was nice. Your voice cadence and tone were nice. The volume level was good. The length of the videos seemed appropriate. Not so long as to lose attention and not too short so that you wear out your mouse clicking the next video.</p>
<p>When showing the command line in the terminal window, the font size there was nice as well!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I have used pip ever since starting with Python, but after taking this course, I found that I was not using it as well as I could be.</p>
<p>In the past I had been manually installing 3rd-party modules and always getting the &lsquo;latest&rsquo; versions when moving environments or starting new ones, which sometimes caused problems with code - not to mention that I sometimes forgot which modules I needed to install!</p>
<p><strong>With the workflow outlined, I think my programs will become a lot more portable; this was the missing piece I needed to start on my continuous integration project with Jenkins!</strong></p>
<p><strong>Overall this course was full of straight-forward examples and will definitely help me untangle the web that is Python.</strong>&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;<strong>I have just finished the course. I found it excellent!</strong></p>
<p>On a non-technical note, may I say that you have an excellent &lsquo;manner&rsquo; for teaching. Your voice is easy on the ears (I know that may sound daft but some trainers, in my experience, tend to get, or try to be, SUPER EXCITED about everything and it can become somewhat grating after a while) and very clear. You do not speak too slowly, or too fast.</p>
<p>And it&rsquo;s all beautifully edited and seamless. <strong>It just kind of feels like you&rsquo;re having a nice conversation with a programmer friend who is in the same room with you, sharing his hard-earned experience and knowledge. Outstanding.</strong></p>
<p>I have used venv and pip already but only as a means to an end, so to speak. e.g. I am learning Django at the moment and that introduced me to these tools by necessity. But I&rsquo;ve only skimmed the surface of them to get to Django, so to speak&hellip;</p>
<p><strong>So your course taught me a lot; ready for when I&rsquo;m doing production projects that actually matter.</strong> (I met venv back learning Python itself on Linux - but it was still very useful to go through it again properly.)&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>Dan has made an easy to follow course to get the fundamentals right with Python packages and dependency management.</strong></p>
<p>The course also covers the essentials of virtual environments, which are key part of managing dependencies especially on your development environment.</p>
<p>My favorite part is module four where Dan explains his well-defined and practical process, how he finds the quality packages, among the vast number of alternatives, using couple of tools. The module covers several important points, when selecting the right third-party packages for your project. One of the most important ones being licensing, especially if you are building a commercial application. Dan goes through the checks how he identifies the quality of the package in question. He also lays out how to justify your package selection to your colleagues or manager.</p>
<p><strong>Overall, Dan did a great job with the course. The course is well organized, easy to follow, and full of practical real life examples.</strong></p>
<p><strong>I very much recommend this course especially to Python beginners, since this will possibly save a lot of time when getting started with the language and its ecosystem. There&rsquo;s something new to learn for more seasoned Python developers, too.</strong>&ldquo;</p>

<p>Maybe you&rsquo;re thinking &ldquo;Yeah, this sounds helpful. But how do I know this course is going to help ME?&rdquo;</p>
<p>I hear you.</p>
<p>The last thing I want is for you to pass on this course because you&rsquo;re not sure it&rsquo;ll work for you. I&rsquo;m 100% confident it <u>will</u> so here&rsquo;s my offer to you:</p>
<p>Put my word to the test. Take <em>Managing Python Dependencies</em> for a spin today.</p>
<p>Spend just an hour with the course today and start building your Python dependency management skills.</p>
<p>Then take up to a full year to apply your newfound knowledge.</p>
<p>And if for some reason you don&rsquo;t agree that I&rsquo;ve given you a faster, easier way to take your practical Python skills to the level you need to rise head-and-shoulders above other developers, I will either:</p>
<p>A) Jump on Skype with you for 30 minutes of 1-on-1 coaching to help you bust through whatever roadblocks are holding you back. My consulting rate for 1:1 coaching is $250 an hour, so this is a risk for me. But I want you to succeed at this and I&rsquo;m confident in my product.</p>
<p>B) Or, if you prefer, I&rsquo;ll cheerfully refund your money in full. No questions, no hassles, any time within the next year. You can even keep the bonuses for giving it a try.</p>
<p>Either way, all the risk is on me.</p>
