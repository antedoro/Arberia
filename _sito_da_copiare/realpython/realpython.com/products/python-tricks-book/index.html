<p>There&rsquo;s a talented Python web developer I know of&mdash;I&rsquo;ll call him &ldquo;Mark&rdquo;.</p>
<p>Mark&rsquo;s a self-taught programmer and fledgling Pythonista, and he&rsquo;s working hard to grow his skills. He&rsquo;s grateful for his coding job and came to Python from far lands of Java and .NET.</p>
<p>Thanks to the internet and Stack Overflow he made amazing progress ramping up his Python skills early on.</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="but-lately-mark-has-gotten-himself-stuck-in-a-valley-of-despairwhere-learning-progress-is-slow-as-molasses">But lately Mark has gotten himself <strong>stuck in a &ldquo;Valley of Despair&rdquo;</strong>&mdash;where learning progress is&hellip; slow&hellip; as&hellip; molasses&hellip;<a class="headerlink" href="#but-lately-mark-has-gotten-himself-stuck-in-a-valley-of-despairwhere-learning-progress-is-slow-as-molasses" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>It didn&rsquo;t look like it in the beginning, but picking up the basics of Python was the easy part. What was a quick learning curve initially has completely petered out as of late.</p>
<p>Now of course, Mark still enjoys working with Python&mdash;it&rsquo;s a beautiful programming language, after all. (One of my coworkers used to call it <em>The Language of the Gods</em>.)</p>
<p>But it&rsquo;s tough feeling <u>confident</u> using Python when it seems like he&rsquo;s forever <u>stuck at a basic level</u> of proficiency.</p>
<p>I mean, it&rsquo;s fairly easy for him to come up with working solutions to most problems he faces with Python&mdash;</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="but-theres-no-roadmap-for-mark-to-take-his-python-skills-to-the-next-level">But there&rsquo;s no roadmap for Mark to take his Python skills to the next level&hellip;<a class="headerlink" href="#but-theres-no-roadmap-for-mark-to-take-his-python-skills-to-the-next-level" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>He doesn&rsquo;t know what Python features and &ldquo;hidden gems&rdquo; are available that might be useful.</p>
<p>And that makes it so challenging&mdash;learning how to integrate all the pieces of the puzzle:</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="ive-been-coding-in-python-full-time-for-a-year-and-still-dont-feel-like-i-have-any-idea-what-im-doing">&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve been coding in Python full-time for a year and still don&rsquo;t feel like I have any idea what I&rsquo;m doing&rdquo;<a class="headerlink" href="#ive-been-coding-in-python-full-time-for-a-year-and-still-dont-feel-like-i-have-any-idea-what-im-doing" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>A mindset of constant improvement and wanting to <u>master</u> the art of programming is really what drives Mark.</p>
<p>Yet, reading the technical documentation for <em>everything</em> would take up too much work during his day job&hellip;with his boss breathing down his neck.</p>
<p>Also, technical docs rarely seem to include the clear use cases and examples he so desperately wants.</p>
<p>Mark has discovered a few lesser-known features in Python that boosted his productivity, but again hunting those tricks down on forums and Stack Overflow sucks up too much of his productive time.</p>
<p>There&rsquo;s not enough curation.</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="and-now-marks-dream-of-mastering-python-is-slowly-withering-away">And now Mark&rsquo;s dream of mastering Python is slowly withering away&hellip;<a class="headerlink" href="#and-now-marks-dream-of-mastering-python-is-slowly-withering-away" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>I totally identify with Mark, <strong>because a few years ago, that was me.</strong></p>
<div class="mugshot">
<p><img alt="Dan" src="https://files.realpython.com/media/daniel-square.d58bf4388750.jpg" title="Oh hey!" /></p>
</div>
<p>My name is Dan Bader. I own and run Real Python and I&rsquo;ve been writing code for more than 15 years.</p>
<p>Mastering Python has been (and still is) a huge motivation for me in my career as a software developer.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m sharing Mark&rsquo;s story with you because I&rsquo;ve experienced similar struggles trying to grow my own Python skills.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;ve dedicated the last several months of my professional life helping other Python developers overcome those struggles.</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="not-too-long-ago-i-discovered-a-fun-effective-technique-to-teach-developers-the-best-practices-and-skills-for-writing-clean-and-beautiful-python-in-bite-sized-chunks">Not too long ago I discovered a fun &amp; effective technique to teach developers the <u>best practices and skills</u> for writing <strong>clean and beautiful Python</strong>,<br> in bite-sized chunks<a class="headerlink" href="#not-too-long-ago-i-discovered-a-fun-effective-technique-to-teach-developers-the-best-practices-and-skills-for-writing-clean-and-beautiful-python-in-bite-sized-chunks" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>I called this technique <strong>Python Tricks</strong>.</p>
<p>&ldquo;Python Tricks&rdquo; started out as a short series of Python code screenshots that I shared on Twitter for a week &mdash;</p>
<p>To my surprise, they got rave responses and were shared and retweeted for days on end. Python developers around the world loved them.</p>
<h2 class="crosshead" id="this-is-a-python-trick">This is a Python Trick:<a class="headerlink" href="#this-is-a-python-trick" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<div class="flex-grid">
<div class="col">
<p style="margin-top: 0; margin-right: 1em;"><strong>Python Trick</strong>: <em>A short Python code snippet meant as a teaching tool.</em></p>
<p style="margin-right: 1em;"><em>A Python Trick either teaches an aspect of Python with a simple illustration, or it serves as a motivating example, enabling you to dig deeper and develop an intuitive understanding.</em></p>
</div>
<div class="col" style="">
<img src="https://files.realpython.com/media/pytrick-dict-merge.4201a0125a5e.png" />
</div>
</div>
<p>These short-and-sweet code examples seemed worth exploring further as a teaching tool&hellip;</p>
<p>Over the next days and weeks, a steady stream of Python developers reached out to me. They thanked me for making an aspect of Python they were struggling to understand <em>click</em> for them.</p>
<p>They found immense value in these &ldquo;Python Tricks&rdquo;, and told me how they helped get their learning progress unstuck and brought them back on the path to Python mastery.</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="hearing-this-feedback-felt-awesome-these-python-tricks-were-just-code-screenshots-i-thought">Hearing this feedback felt awesome. These Python Tricks were &ldquo;just code screenshots&rdquo;, I thought<a class="headerlink" href="#hearing-this-feedback-felt-awesome-these-python-tricks-were-just-code-screenshots-i-thought" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>But so many Python developers loved them&mdash;</p>
<p>So simple, yet so valuable.</p>
<p>As more and more developers signed up to receive my Python Tricks emails, I started noticing a pattern in the replies and questions I got:</p>
<p>Some Python Tricks worked great as motivational examples by themselves&mdash;but for the more complex ones there was no narrator to guide readers, no one to give them additional resources to develop a deeper understanding.</p>
<h2 class="crosshead thin" id="i-realized-that-sometimes-just-a-code-screenshot-isnt-enough-to-explain-a-cool-python-feature">I realized that sometimes &ldquo;just a code screenshot&rdquo; isn&rsquo;t enough to explain a cool Python feature<a class="headerlink" href="#i-realized-that-sometimes-just-a-code-screenshot-isnt-enough-to-explain-a-cool-python-feature" title="Permanent link"></a></h2>
<p>These early Python Tricks were valuable, but also ultimately flawed.</p>
<p>Now Python Tricks is back with with a vengeance &mdash;</p>
<p>I took the best and most popular Python Tricks (+ brand new ones!) from the original series and started writing a new kind of Python book around them:</p>
<h1 class="crosshead" id="python-tricks-the-booka-buffet-of-awesome-python-features"><em>Python Tricks: The Book</em><br>A Buffet of Awesome Python Features<a class="headerlink" href="#python-tricks-the-booka-buffet-of-awesome-python-features" title="Permanent link"></a></h1>

<p>&ldquo;I first heard about your book from a co-worker who wanted to trick me with your example of how dictionaries are built. I was almost 100% sure about the reason why the end product was a much smaller/simpler dictionary but I must confess that I did not expect the outcome :)</p>
<p>He showed me the book via video conferencing and I sort of skimmed through it as he flipped the pages for me, and I was immediately curious to read more.</p>
<p>That same afternoon I purchased my own copy and proceeded to read your explanation for the way dictionaries are created in Python and later that day, as I met a different co-worker for coffee, I used the same trick on him :)</p>
<p>He then sprung a different question on the same principle, and because of the way you explained things in your book, I was able to **not** guess the result but correctly answer what the outcome would be.</p>
<p>That means that you did a great job at explaining things :)</p>
<p><strong>I am not new in Python and some of the concepts in some of the chapters are not new to me, but I must say that I do get something out of every chapter so far, so kudos for writing a very nice book and for doing a fantastic job at explaining concepts behind the tricks!</strong></p>
<p>I&rsquo;m very much looking forward to the updates and I will certainly let my friends and co-workers know about your book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I really enjoyed reading Dan&rsquo;s book. He explains important Python aspects with clear examples (using two twin cats to explain &ldquo;is&rdquo; vs &ldquo;==&rdquo; for example).</p>
<p>It is not just code samples, it discusses relevant implementation details comprehensibly.</p>
<p><strong>What really matters though is that this book makes you write better Python code!</strong></p>
<p>The book is actually responsible for recent new good py habits I picked up, for example: using custom exceptions and ABC&rsquo;s (I found Dan&rsquo;s blog searching for abstract classes).</p>
<p><strong>These new learnings alone are worth the price.</strong>&ldquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I love love love the book so far. It&rsquo;s like having a seasoned tutor explaining, well, tricks!</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m learning python on the job and I&rsquo;m coming from powershell, which I learned on the job - so lots of new, great stuff. Whenever I get stuck in python (usually with flask blueprints or I feel like my code could be more pythonic) I post questions in our internal Python chat room.</p>
<p>I&rsquo;m often amazed at some of the answers coworkers give me. Dict comprehensions, lambdas, and generators often pepper their feedback.</p>
<p>I am always impressed and yet flabbergasted at how powerful python is when you know these tricks and can implement them correctly.</p>
<p><strong>Your book was exactly what I wanted to help get me from a bewildered powershell scripter to someone who knows how and when to use these pythonic &lsquo;tricks&rsquo; everyone has been talking about.</strong></p>
<p>As someone who doesn&rsquo;t have my degree in CS it&rsquo;s nice to have the text to explain things that others might have learned when they were classically educated.</p>
<p>I am really enjoying the book and am subscribed to the email as well, which is how I found out about the book.&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;Dear Dan,</p>
<p>I want to tell you how much I appreciated your Python Tricks book which I bought and read today.
Even an intermediate Pythonista will find new facets and snippets to use and show off among coworkers. ;-)</p>
<p>Most of all I like the format of your book, serving the information in small self-contained chunks.</p>
<p>Even for very clever guys like myself ;-) this is the best way to learn.</p>
<p>Far from being just a shallow collection of snippets, your book will leave the attentive reader with a deeper understanding of the inner workings of Python as well as an appreciation for its beauty.</p>
<p>So, big kudos for &lsquo;Python Tricks&rsquo;!&rdquo;</p>

<p>&ldquo;I&rsquo;ve only started pythoning like for a year now. Just when I thought I&rsquo;ve got all the basics right, this book just blew my mind.</p>
<p>It&rsquo;s amazing how in the 40 pages I&rsquo;ve covered so far, I&rsquo;ve learnt so much more of these concepts. So thank you for this great book. I absolutely love it.&rdquo;</p>

<blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;<strong>I&rsquo;ve been developing in Python for quite a few years now, and I&rsquo;m discovering lots of interesting and useful information in your book.</strong></p>
<p>I love idioms, particularly in Python with its &ldquo;one obvious way to do something&rdquo; approach to programming.</p>
<p>Your in depth look at how things work is great because it makes me re-think some of the assumptions I have about Python, and either take precautions or advantage of what I just learned.&rdquo;</p>

<hr />
<p>The last thing I want is for you to pass on this book because you&rsquo;re not sure it&rsquo;ll help you on your Python journey. I&rsquo;m 100% confident it <u>will</u> so here&rsquo;s my offer to you:</p>
<p>Put me to the test. Take <em>Python Tricks: The Book</em> for a spin today.</p>
<p>Spend just an hour with the book today while I help you develop a deeper understanding of some important Python concepts.</p>
<p>Then take up to a full year to apply your newfound knowledge.</p>
<p>And if for some reason you don&rsquo;t agree that I&rsquo;ve given you at least one &ldquo;Python epiphany&rdquo; by reading this book, I will cheerfully refund your money in full. No questions, no hassles, any time within the next year.</p>
<p>All the risk is on me.</p>
<p>&mdash; Dan Bader</p>

<p><strong>Got any sample chapters?</strong> Sure do! <a href="/python-tricks-sample-pdf">Click here to download</a> a PDF sample. Enjoy 😊</p>
<p><strong>Can I order a print version?</strong> Yes, Python Tricks is available on Amazon as a printed book. <a href="/python-tricks-amazon">Click here to order a printed copy</a> 📘</p>
<p><strong>Is this just a bunch of code screenshots?</strong> Nope, this adds a whole new dimension to the Python Tricks emails. I felt like what was missing from the screenshot-based Tricks was a narrative that could explain what&rsquo;s going on, connect the dots, and point out additional learning resources. Check out the sample chapters if you&rsquo;re curious what it looks like.</p>
<p><strong>What if I don&rsquo;t like the book?</strong> I want happy customers only. If you&rsquo;re not happy with the digital version of the book, send me an email and tell me where it left you hanging. I&rsquo;ll refund you in full&mdash;even 12 months later.</p>
<p><strong>I have another question!</strong> Please email me at info@realpython.com and I&rsquo;ll get back to you as soon as possible.</p>
