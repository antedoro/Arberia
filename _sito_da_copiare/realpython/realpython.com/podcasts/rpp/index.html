<p><em>&ldquo;Thanks for starting this channel! Loving Real Python for its courses, articles and exercises. I was looking for something to listen to, to hear some experiences, and keep updated and this is perfect for this. A baby Python from France!&rdquo;</em> (⭐⭐⭐⭐⭐)</p>

<p><em>&ldquo;Hello Christopher and Real Python Podcast team,</em></p>
<p><em>I&rsquo;ve quickly become a regular listener of your podcast, and just wanted to drop you a quick email and say how glad I am that you&rsquo;ve launched this podcast, and how much I appreciate your episodes.</em></p>
<p><em>Like you, I&rsquo;m relatively new to Python. I&rsquo;ve recently begun using it regularly at work, so the topics and the libraries you highlight have been extremely helpful to me.</em></p>
<p><em>A perfect example is your recent episode on Python packaging. This is something veterans are probably all familiar with, but there are a lot of confusing examples out there. I was able to listen to your episode, head over to the tutorial you were talking about, and create my first Python package, which I then shared with several other non-profits.</em></p>
<p><em>That&rsquo;s just one of many examples. But I wanted you to know that your efforts are very helpful, and very much appreciated.</em></p>
<p><em>Thanks and keep up the great work!&rdquo;</em></p>
<p class="mt-n2 mb-4">&mdash; <strong>Bryan Hermsen</strong> (via email)</p>
<p><em>&ldquo;Good interview and great job with the podcast! It is amazing how good this podcast is in such a short time. The timecodes and copious show notes and links really set it apart. Keep up the good work!&rdquo;</em></p>

</p>
<p>Where are you along the path of learning Python? Do you feel like you&#x27;re making progress? What are ways you can put the learning path into a more precise focus? This week on the show, we talk with previous guest Martin Breuss about his recent article &quot;How Long Does It Take to Learn Python?&quot;</p>

<p>Are you a beginner or intermediate Python programmer who has made it through some of the fundamentals? Have you tried to tackle a big project but got stuck and frustrated? Completing some small projects might be the answer. This week on the show, we have author Al Sweigart and talk about his new book, &quot;The Big Book of Small Python Projects.&quot;</p>

<p>How well do you know Python&#x27;s math module? Maybe you&#x27;ve used a few of the constants or arithmetic functions. You may be surprised by the amount of functionality hiding within this built-in library, and perhaps you don&#x27;t need to reach for an additional outside library. This week on the show, David Amos is back, and he&#x27;s brought another batch of PyCoder&#x27;s Weekly articles and projects.</p>

<p>Have you started to use Python&#x27;s assignment expression in your code? Maybe you have heard them called the walrus operator. Now that the controversy over the introduction in Python 3.8 has settled down, how can you use assignment expressions effectively in your code?

<p>Are you still sprinkling print statements throughout your code while writing it? Print statements are often clunky and offer only a limited view of the state of your code.
